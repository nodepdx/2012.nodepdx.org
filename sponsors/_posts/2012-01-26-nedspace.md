### Who Are They?

[NedSpace](http://www.nedspace.com/) is the place where entrepreneurs build companies. NedSpace provides what early-stage and startup companies need to foster their ideas and create viable businesses. The heart of NedSpace is peer support. Entrepreneurs engage one another in business ideas, marketing plans, investor contacts, sales growth strategies, staffing/HR or just-in-time hail-mary-style advice. NedSpace gets entrepreneurs out of garages and coffee shops and into an environment that builds real companies.

### What Did They Contribute?

[NedSpace](http://www.nedspace.com/) donated thier [Downtown office space](http://www.nedspace.com/node/3) for free, for two days. They absolutely rock. Like those walls, that roof, that bathroom? Thank NedSpace for loaning it to us. Who knows, maybe you like it so much you want to [become a member](http://www.nedspace.com/members) ?
