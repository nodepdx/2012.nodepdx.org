The event space for NodePDX 2012 is finally settled. Thanks so much to Mark Grimes over at [NedSpace](http://www.nedspace.com/) for the donation. It's really awesome how supportive our community is here (in case you needed any further proof that Portland, Oregon is the best place in the world). 

Nedspace is a comfy environment for the main event, with great access to public transportation, a [nice bar](http://www.cegportland.com/lotus) right next door and all the amenities that being centrally located in the heart of downtown Portland offers.

This was the last major piece towards making this a completely "money free" conference. If only I can get someone to donate coffee and beer...

Also, if anyone is interested in volunteering, I will need a bit of help setting up the event space, cleaning up afterwards, managing door security, etc.. Please email troy@nodepdx.org if you're interested!
